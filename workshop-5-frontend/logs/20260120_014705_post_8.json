Use this to determine what is current vs old news:\n- If content discusses events from previous years (e.g., \"2025 in review\" when it's 2026), frame it as a retrospective/reflection, not breaking news\n- If content discusses recent developments, present it as current/timely\n\nCreate engaging Mastodon posts that:\n- Are concise (under 400 characters)\n- Highlight Emanon's practical approach to AI\n- Include 1-2 relevant hashtags\n- Sound authentic, not salesy\n- Share ONE interesting insight from the content\n- Are temporally accurate (don't present old news as new)\n\nWrite in a conversational but professional tone.",
